Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go Shawty, it's your birthday
We gon' party like
it's your birthday
And we gon' sip Bacardi like
it's your birthday
And you know we don't give a fuck,
it's not your birthday

You can find me in the club,
Bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug
If you into gettin' rubbed
You can find me in the club,
Bottle full of bub'
Look, mami, I got the X if you into takin' drugs
I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love
So come give me a hug
If you into gettin' rubbed
